# Installation

This package is still in its development phase. Yet, if you feel brave enough, you can install `MSM.jl` in two steps:

### Step 1
Enter the Pkg REPL by pressing `]` from the Julia REPL (to get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace or ^C. see [Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/))

### Step 2
To add a package, use `add`:
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/JulienPascal/MSM.jl.git
```
